# System Tray Setup Guide

## Current Status
Your Reminder App is working perfectly! The "Hide to Background" functionality is currently using **Windows taskbar minimization** as a fallback.

## Enable Full System Tray (Optional)

If you want the full system tray experience with a small tray icon, you can install the optional dependencies:

### Step 1: Install System Tray Dependencies
```bash
pip install pystray Pillow
```

### Step 2: Restart the App
After installing the packages, restart the Reminder App to enable full system tray functionality.

## How It Works

### Without Dependencies (Current)
- âœ… "Hide to Background" moves app to Windows taskbar
- âœ… Shows helpful message about how to restore the window
- âœ… Look for "ðŸ“‹ Reminders (Hidden)" in your taskbar
- âœ… Click to restore or right-click for menu

### With Dependencies (Enhanced)
- âœ… "Hide to Background" creates a small system tray icon
- âœ… System tray icon appears in the notification area
- âœ… Right-click tray icon for full menu
- âœ… Double-click tray icon to show window

## Both Methods Work Great!

Your app is fully functional either way. The system tray dependencies are completely optional and only add convenience.

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "System tray failed" message:
1. The app automatically falls back to taskbar minimization
2. This is normal and expected behavior
3. No action needed - everything still works

### To test system tray after installing dependencies:
1. Close the current app
2. Run: `python check_dependencies.py` to verify installation
3. Start the app: `python reminder_app.py`
4. Click "Hide to Background" - you should see a system tray icon

## Security Note
- pystray and Pillow are well-maintained, popular packages
- They're only used for creating the system tray icon
- The app works perfectly without them
