# 🖼️ System Tray Setup Guide

## Current Implementation
Your Reminder App currently works with **Windows taskbar minimization** - when you click "Hide to Background", the app minimizes to your Windows taskbar with the title "📋 Reminders (Hidden)".

## Optional: True System Tray Icon

For a proper system tray icon (in the notification area), you can optionally install additional packages:

### Installation Steps:

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```cmd
   pip install pystray pillow
   ```

2. **Restart the Reminder App**
   - The app will automatically detect the packages
   - "Hide to Background" will now create a real system tray icon
   - Right-click the tray icon for options

### What You Get:

✅ **Without packages (current):**
- Minimizes to taskbar
- Click taskbar item to restore
- Fully functional

✅ **With packages (enhanced):**
- True system tray icon
- Right-click menu in tray
- Professional appearance
- Hidden from taskbar when minimized

### Package Information:

- **`pystray`**: Creates system tray icons
- **`pillow`**: Image processing for tray icon
- Both are safe, lightweight packages

## Troubleshooting:

**If packages fail to install:**
- The app works fine without them
- You'll still get taskbar minimization
- No functionality is lost

**If you prefer taskbar only:**
- Don't install the packages
- The current system works perfectly

## Current Features Work Either Way:

- ✅ Hide to background functionality
- ✅ Reminder notifications
- ✅ All app features remain the same
- ✅ Serial numbers in reminder list
- ✅ Email export functionality
- ✅ Email setup guide

The choice is yours - both options provide a great experience!
